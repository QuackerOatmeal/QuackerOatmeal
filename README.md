- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuackerOatmeal, also known as MarkDavid
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming but I want to specialize in Artificial Intelligence, particularly systems pushing the envelope on what AI can do.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java in College, just wrapping up my first quarter and CS141. On to Java 142 in the Fall and currently doing CS50 Python program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever can develop my skills or allow me to meet people that can help evolve them.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Best bet is Discord @ omfgisuk, but if there is an inbox here that works too.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: A fun fact is that I am an older student and figuring this all out at 37. I've got a history in the military and a
- colorful background that has given me the opportunity to have a lot of patience and understanding for others. I love playing video games, reading, and hanging out with GF.
